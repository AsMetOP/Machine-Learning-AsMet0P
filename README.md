# 📘 Machine Learning Journey w/ AsMet0P

Welcome! 👋   
This repository documents my **Machine Learning learning journey**.  
It contains **structured notes, concept explanations, algorithm implementations from scratch, experiments, and practice work** as I build a strong foundation in Machine Learning.

The goal of this repository is **conceptual clarity + hands-on implementation**.
